Hello-World
===========

Apparently I am new at this.

I have learned a little about CS101 from Stanfords MOOC and a bit of SQL (intermediate level from their trainig school) on MODE.
I've signed up for the Data Science Specialization from John Hopkins that begins today and I am taking several analystics courses in my final elective period at IE Business school to complete my MBA.  I've also enjoyed reading Big Data Baseball and am currently reading Big Data for Business.  

I hope to learn more here and get to a point where I can be of help to others who are starting out as I am today.

Best,
Don
